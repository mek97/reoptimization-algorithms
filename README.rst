Repotimization Algorithms
=========================

This package implements some well known Reoptimization algorithms

Graph Data structure
--------------------
- The graph data structures implementation is based on an adjacency list representation.
- The graph adjacency structure is implemented as a Python dictionary of dictionaries, the outer dictionary is keyed by vertices and mapped to neighboring vertex forming an edge.
- Vertices and Edges are provided with a weight property
- Supports CRUD operations on vertices and edges of graph
-  Reference `Adjacency list`_, Further read `Introduction to Graph Theory By Douglas Brent West`_
