============
Introduction
============
Currently, considerable efforts must be put to find optimal solution for NP-Hard problems.
Reoptimisation deals with, If given an optimal solution to a problem instance I\ :sub:`O`,
can we find a good approximated solution to instance I\ :sub:`N`, where I\ :sub:`N` is I\ :sub:`O` with some 'local' modifications?
The goal in this repository is to expose some well known reoptimization algorithms.
